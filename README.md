# HIERARCHICAL_CLUSTERING 

# PROJECT TITLE
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers".csv of American mall Market called as Phoneix Mall to findout on the basis of Client Requirement of Dendrograms using scipy Graphics Library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierachy",to ace the no.of linkage of clustering to predict

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The American Finance market Clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.

As a Datascience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.

#  TASK

1) With help of Scipy Library import libraries and datasets

2) Using the Dendogram to find th optimal number of clusters

3) Create a Hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with help of matplot library

# INSIGHTS  

Cluster 1 contains (red)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 139k$.

Cluster 2 contains (blue)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 79 to 80k$.

Cluster 3 contains (red)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 139k$.

Cluster 4 contains (red)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 40k$

Cluster 5 contains (red)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum euliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 40k$.
